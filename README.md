# Use-of-SQL-magic-command-method-to-work-in-python-project
About project:
Sometimes we required to simultanously analyse data in both SQL and python, using the capabilities of one to complement the other and making the analysis seamless. This poses a serious challenge as we are rerquired to work on different development environment to get this done. 
In this project I mastered and showcased how SQL and python programs can work together in a single code snippet using the magic(%%) commands and ipython_sql extension. This way, you can write a python code and use it directly in your SQL program and  vice versa.

There are four notebooks in this repository and each delve deep into different stages of the project. 
I used the SQLite3 serverless database in two of the notebooks and used IBM Db2 cloud database in the other two, replicating the same results in the two cases.

NOTE: The API keys made available in this notebook is for temporary IBM Db2 database solely for learning and practice purposes. All API calls and changes made on the database using those keys reverses after 30mins.
